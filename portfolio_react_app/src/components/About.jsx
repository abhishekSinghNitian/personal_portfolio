          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          I am a student of B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering
          at NIT Patna, with a passion for software development and
          problem-solving. Throughout this academic journey, I’ve built a solid
          foundation in data structures and algorithms, object-oriented
          programming, Database management system and operating system.
          <br />
          <br />
          My hands-on experience includes building dynamic web applications
          using ReactJS, API integration, and responsive design with Tailwind
          CSS. I have worked on projects like real-time weather forecasting and
          a responsive portfolio website, showcasing my technical skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          I’ve solved over 500 problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef,
          and GFG, highlighting my dedication to improving coding and
          problem-solving capabilities. I have expertise in front-end and
          back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
          MongoDB, and MySQL.
          <br />
          <br />
          My strong time management, leadership, and adaptability, coupled with
          my passion for software engineering, position me as a strong candidate
          for software development roles. I look forward to contributing to
          challenging environments where I can continue to grow and learn.
